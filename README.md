<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Features

- **Leaderboard**: A comprehensive leaderboard that displays user scores based on metrics such as health, energy, and pollution. Users can see their rankings and compare their performance with peers, motivating friendly competition.
- **Daily Quests**: Offers daily challenges that encourage users to take eco-friendly actions, such as riding bikes, using public transportation, and reducing vehicle emissions. Completing quests rewards users with points that contribute to their overall score.
- **Moving Banner**: An animated banner that scrolls important environmental messages across the screen, reminding users of the importance of their actions.
- **Gamification Elements**: Incorporates badges, rewards, and achievements to keep users engaged and motivated to continue participating.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across a variety of devices, making it easy to access on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## How It Works

Green Duck tracks user engagement through specific eco-friendly activities and records points in real-time. The leaderboard updates automatically to reflect the accumulated scores, which are composed of three main components:
- **Health Score**: Points earned by participating in activities that promote physical well-being, like walking or cycling.
- **Energy Score**: Points related to the use of energy-efficient or public transportation methods.
- **Pollution Reduction Score**: Points awarded for reducing carbon emissions, such as carpooling or opting for non-motorized travel.

The cumulative **Duck Score** is a sum of these three individual scores and determines a userâ€™s ranking on the leaderboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The framework used for building this cross-platform web application.
- **Dart**: The primary programming language utilized to develop the app.
- **Vercel**: The platform used for seamless web deployment, ensuring high performance and availability.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mojoee/green-duck.git
